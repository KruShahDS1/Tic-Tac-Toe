Game Theory implementation for Tic-Tac-Toe
Game Theory- Minimax and Alpha Beta Pruning - Jupyter Notebook - This notebook explains the implementation of different algorithms for different skill levels for Tic-Tac-Toe.
TicTacProject_High.py - This is the python code file having the main loop code where it displays the board canvas and then based on the input, it checks where the AI Bot should place its next move.
CheckWin_High.py - This file has python code for 3 functions , 1st function is to find which player won i.e. whether the human player won or the AI bot won. The 2nd function is to count the number of X's and O's in 3 consecutive spaces and to decide who won by calling the first function. The 3rd function is used in Minimax to find who won.
